                       SPEC CPU2017 Benchmark Description

  Benchmark Name

   526.blender_r

  Benchmark Authors

   Blender project development volunteers, supported by the Blender
   Foundation

   Adapted for the SPEC CPU2017 suite by the SPEC CPU subcommittee

  Benchmark Program General Category

   3D Rendering

  Benchmark Description

   Blender is a free, open source 3D creation suite. It provides the ability
   to render, model, simulate material properties, and animate assets to
   create 3D images.

  Input Description

   The subbenchmark takes in a blender .blend file. The .blend file specifies
   scene input geometry and rendering parameters.

    Reference Inputs

   The reference input workload in speed mode and rate mode operate on a
   .blend Blender file. The .blend file included with the subbenchmark is a
   reduced version of the Weybec Crazy Glue shot 3 data set. This data set
   input sets the output image size @ 1280x720 pixels.

    Training Inputs

   The input .blend file for the feedback training workload (train) is a
   reduced version the Weybec Crazy Glue shot 5 data set. This data set
   configures the output image size @ 320x200 pixels.

    Test Inputs

   The test workload .blend file is the default cube that loads up with
   public builds of blender in GUI mode.

  Output Description

   The image output from the render step is used as input to the SPEC utility
   [1]imagevalidate, which calculates the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index
   over 8x8 pixel areas between the benchmark-produced image and a
   SPEC-provided expected image. SSIM indexes range from -1 (maximally
   different) to 1 (identical) for each of those regions.

   If the images are too different, the image comparison program will issue
   an error. This is accomplished by specifying a threshold SSIM value, and
   if more than 1% of samples go below the threshold, the benchmark does not
   pass validation.

   In all cases, the expected output suggests a completely identical image

   <filename>: AVG SSIM = 1.000000000


   which is then checked by [2]specdiff to to verify that the overall average
   of SSIM values is at least 0.95.

  Programming Language

   ANSI C

   C++

  Portability Notes

   There several portability flags that may be useful, as shown in the
   example config files -- search for 526.blender_r in
   $SPEC/config/Example*cfg (Unix) or
   %SPEC%\config\Example*.cfg (Windows).

   Documentation of 526.blender_r portability flags is available at
   $SPEC/benchspec/CPU2017/526.blender_r/Docs/flags.html (Unix) or
   %SPEC%\benchspec\CPU2017\526.blender_r\Docs\flags.html (Windows).

    Portability RECOMMENDATION: Use Unsigned Char

   The language standard says that char might have the same behavior as
   either signed char or as unsigned char. It does not specify which. Blender
   code expects char to be unsigned, and the [3]Blender Coding Style Guide
   says "Compiler flags are used to make sure we always use the unsigned
   variety."

   Therefore, if your system defaults to signed, you should find your
   compiler flag that changes to unsigned. If you do not do so, you may see
   many thousands of warning messages during builds, and your generated
   binary might produce wrong answers.

   For example, if you are using GCC, you might set:

 526.blender_r:
   PORTABILITY = -funsigned-char

   Other compilers have similar flags, for example:

     * -qchars=unsigned IBM XLC
     * -xchar=u Oracle Developer Studio
     * -Muchar PGI

   Check your compiler documentation.
